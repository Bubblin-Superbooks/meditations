And this worship consists in keeping it pure from every passion and folly, and from repining at anything done by Gods or men. The work of the Gods is to be reverenced for its excellence. The works of men should be dear for the sake of the bond of kinship, or pitied, as we must pity them sometimes, for their lack of the knowledge of good and evil. And men are not less maimed by this defect than by their want of power to know white from black.</li><li class="stretch-last-line">Though you should live three thousand ears or as many myriads, yet remember that no man loses any other life than that which now lives, nor lives any other</li></ol></div> </div>
