<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><ol start="48"><li class="split-li">if I may so speak, are dead: Helice and Pompeii and Herculaneum, and others past counting. Tell over next all those you have known, one after the other: think how one buried his fellow, then lay dead himself, to be buried by a third. And all this within a little time. In sum, look upon human things, and behold how short-lived and how vile they are; mucus yesterday, tomorrow ashes or pickled carrion. Spend, then, the fleeting remnant of your time in a spirit that accords with Nature, and depart contentedly. So the olive falls when it is grown ripe, blessing the ground from whence it sprung, and thankful to the tree that bore it.</li><li>Be like a promontory against which the waves are always breaking. It stands fast, and stills the waters that rage around it. Wretched am I, says one, that this has befallen me. Nay, say you, happy am I</li></ol></div> </div>
