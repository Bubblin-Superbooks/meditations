The racing drivers used to adopt one of four colours&mdash;red, blue, white, or green&mdash;and their partisans showed an eagerness in supporting them which nothing could surpass. Riot and corruption went in the train of the racing chariots; and from all these things Marcus held severely aloof.</p><p>In 140 Marcus was raised to the consulship, and in 145 his betrothal was consummated by marriage. Two years later Faustina brought him a daughter; and soon after the tribunate and other imperial honours were conferred upon him.</p><p>Antoninus Pius died in 161, and Marcus assumed the imperial state.
