<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><ol><li>The substance of the Universe is docile and pliable. The mind which governs it has in itself no source of evil-doing. It has no malice: it does no ill, and nothing is hurt by it. By its guidance all things come to be, and fulfil their being.</li><li>Act the part which is worthy of you, regarding not whether you be stiff with cold or comfortably warm; whether you be drowsy or refreshed with sleep; whether you be in good report or bad; whether you be dying or upon some other business. For death also is one piece of the business of life, and, here as elsewhere, it is enough to do well what comes to our hand.</li><li>Look within. Let not the proper quality or value of anything escape you.</li><li>All that exists will very speedily change; by rarefaction, if all substance be one; otherwise by dispersion.</li><li class="stretch-last-line">The guiding mind knows what its own condition is,</li></ol></div> </div>
