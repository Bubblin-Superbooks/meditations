What then? You await calmly extinction or transformation, whichever it may be. And till the fulness of the time be come what is to suffice you? What else than a life spent in fearing and praising the Gods, and in the practice of benevolence, toleration and forbearance towards men?

In the second, their happiness lies in having mind and conduct disposed to justice, and in the power to make that the end of all desire.</li><li class="stretch-last-line">If the fault be not my sin, nor a consequence of it,</li></ol></div> </div>
