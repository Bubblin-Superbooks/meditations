<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><ol style="--start:11" start="11"><li class="split-li">live in a world void of Gods and without Providence? But Gods there are, and assuredly they regard human affairs; and they have put it wholly in man's power that he should not fall into what is truly evil. And of other things, had any been bad, they would have made provision also that man should have the power to avoid them altogether. For how can that make a man's life worse which does not corrupt the man himself? Presiding Nature could not in ignorance, or in knowledge impotent, have omitted to prevent or rectify these things. She could not fail us so completely that, either from want of power or want of skill, good and evil should happen promiscuously to good men and to bad alike. Now death and life, glory and reproach, pain and pleasure, riches and povertyâ€”all these happen equally to the good and to the bad. But, as they are neither honourable nor shameful, they are therefore neither good nor evil.</li></ol></div> </div>
