This is perhaps a better saying, Do what is necessary, do what the reason of the being that is social in its nature directs, and do it in the spirit of that direction. By this you will attain the calm that comes from virtuous action, and that calm also which comes from having few things to do. Most things you say and do are not necessary. Have done with them, and you will be more at leisure and less perturbed. On every occasion, then, ask yourself the question, Is this thing not unnecessary? And put away not only unnecessary</li></ol></div> </div>
